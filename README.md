Acute.js
==========

## Want a blog that’s easy to update, but also 100% your own? That’s what [Acute.js](https://github.com/cjcenizal/acute-blogging-framework) is for.

### Chickity-check it out

Acute isn’t quite ready for game-time, but you can check out the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/cjcenizal/acute-blogging-framework). I’m currently dogfooding it on my own site, if you want to see a demo: [cenizal.com](http://www.cenizal.com).

### These are the priciples behind Acute.js.

#### Spend your time *creating* content, not working to get it on your site.

Your website is just a context for presenting content to the world. Acute.js aims to make adding content to your site as easy as adding an HTML file to a folder.

#### **All** of your files in **one** accessible place.

Your site shouldn’t depend on a database or server-side code. It should just be the basics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  All of these files should be logically organized in folders. As an administrator, you should be able to see your entire site represented as an object in a single easy-to-scan file.

#### Customize the way your site *&looks**, without worrying about breaking the way it **works**.

Acute.js should just be an engine that automatically ties together your content. You should be able to change your site’s skin without the skeleton getting in the way.
